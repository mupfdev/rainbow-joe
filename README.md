# Rainbow Joe
A constantly evolving project I work on to learn the art of game programming.  
Also: follow-on project of
[Janitor Jamboree](https://github.com/mupfelofen-de/janitor-jamboree) which I
have discarded.

## Dependencies and how to compile
The program has been successfully compiled with the following libraries:
```
libxml2    2.9.8
sdl2       2.0.8
sdl2_image 2.0.3
sdl2_mixer 2.0.2
zlib       1.2.11
```

To compile _Rainbow Joe_ simply enter:
```
make
```

To generate the documentation using doxygen enter:
```
doxygen
```

## Title
The quite odd game title was generated using
[The Video Game Name Generator](https://www.videogamena.me/).
